# Project Overview

> The THEIA project tasks us with creating a UI for an application that is meant for searching and analyzing metadata. Theia aims to combine data processing, and Natural Language Processing. By combining these processes, Theia will facilitate extracting information from: documents, samples, system architectures, and even code conversion outputs so that they can be further processed and analyzed.

# Project Progress

## Month 1 Design
<div>
    <p1> During the first month of Theia project, our focus was on translating wireframes provided by the        Illumination Works Team into tangible designs while acquiring the necessary technological expertise. Given that the project was slated for React, a JavaScript library for UI development, we embarked on a learning journey. Despite having a clear end goal, our team initially grappled with the process of replicating the wireframes.<br>
    </p1><br> 
    <p3>
    To bridge this knowledge gap, we commenced by completing the React tutorial to gain a solid foundation in the technology. With growing confidence in our React skills, we commenced the construction of key components, namely the Article box and the Tag component. The latter proved particularly crucial as it pervaded various facets of the UI, laying a foundational aspect for the project's progression.

    <p><br> These images below show our progress after month one with the bottom image being the wireframe that we were working towards.

    <h2 id="month-2-development">Month 2 Development</h2>
    <p>In the second month of the Theia project, our focus shifted towards refining the wireframes to align our UI more closely with the initial designs. We made significant progress, particularly in implementing key features such as the "Save Article" button, accompanied by a sidebar to store saved articles. Additionally, we enhanced the functionality and aesthetics of the tag component, incorporating updated styling and enabling server-side filtering based on the selected tags.</p>
    <p>Moreover, we introduced the article view feature, providing users with a dedicated space to view articles. These advancements represent a substantial step forward in realizing our vision for Theia's user interface, bringing us closer to delivering a polished and functional product.</p>

    <strong>Technologies</strong>
    <p></p>
    <strong>React</strong>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/h5KBdWg.png" width="240" height="220" />
    <p>React is a JavaScript library primarily used for building user interfaces (UIs) in web applications. Developed by Facebook, React allows developers to create reusable UI components that efficiently update and render in response to data changes. It utilizes a declarative programming style, where developers describe how the UI should look at any given point in time, and React takes care of updating the DOM (Document Object Model) to match this desired state.</p>
    <strong>Vite</strong>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ygmHSeM.jpeg" width="240" height="240" />
    <p>Vite is a modern build tool for front-end development that aims to optimize the development experience by leveraging native ES Module support in modern browsers. It serves as a fast and efficient alternative to traditional bundlers like Webpack.</p>
    <strong>Axios</strong>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/7QdJ8LX.png" width="480" height="80" />
    <p>Axios is a popular JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests from both the browser and Node.js environments. It provides a simple and elegant API for performing asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from a server or sending data to a server.</p>
    <strong>Neo4J</strong>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/mrUIjk9.png" width="480" height="240" />
    <p>Neo4j is a highly scalable and schema-free graph database management system. It is designed to store, manage, and query highly interconnected data, making it particularly suited for use cases involving complex relationships and network-like structures.</p>
